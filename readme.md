# Tea Bud Image Datasets

This repository provides three datasets â€” **A**, **B**, and **C** â€” designed for research on tea bud detection,
classification.  
Each dataset contains high-resolution images of tea buds captured under different lighting and environmental conditions,
suitable for training and evaluating computer vision models.

## Dataset Overview

- **Dataset A**: The most complex, consisting of raw images directly captured from real-world environments without special processing, containing a large number of small objects.
- **Dataset B**: Moderately difficult, with most objects being of medium size and some small objects present.
- **Dataset C**: The simplest, primarily containing medium to large objects, which are relatively easy to recognize.

# Environment and Usage Instructions

This section describes the recommended system environment, software dependencies, and usage workflow for training and
evaluating tea bud recognition models.

## 1. System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, Ubuntu 20.04+
- **Hardware Configuration:**
    - GPU: NVIDIA RTX 5070 or higher (â‰¥12 GB VRAM recommended)
    - CPU: Intel i7 / AMD Ryzen 7 or better
    - RAM: â‰¥32 GB
    - Storage: â‰¥100 GB of free disk space

## 2. Software Environment

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.10
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch = 2.9.0
- **Essential Libraries:**
    - OpenCV = 4.12.0.88
    - albumentations â‰¥ 2.0.8
    - NumPy
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib
- **Annotation Tools (optional):** LabelImg, X-AnyLabeling

## 3. Installation and Setup

```bash
# Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/hulonghe/buds-detect.git
cd buds-detect

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # (Linux/macOS)
venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Training and Evaluation Workflow

Download and extract the tea bud datasets (A, B, C). Start training:

```bash
python train_reg.py
```

Evaluate the trained model:

```bash
python validate_reg.py
```

Training logs, metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, mAP), and model checkpoints will be saved in the ./runs directory.

## 5. Recommendations

Adjust batch size and learning rate according to GPU memory limits.
Use mixed precision training (torch.amp) to speed up convergence.
